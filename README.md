smashed together learning project for me, based on Herbert Wolverson's book ( https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/ )

Rust, bracket-lib/rltk, specs

## ideas

- enemy called a REY that shoots a ranged attack light beam that makes you drop an item
- rogue blade vendor named PEPPERMINT WHOPPER MCGILLICUDY III
- wizard baker that obtains mysterious unique and rare foraged oddities, and creates psychadelic pastries that are like potions. lives in the woods for sure, in a tree stump, maybe foggy. nobody knows who he is, but folk lore tells legends of 'the wizard', he might be one but doesn't know if he is or not. he thinks he knows people bc he sacrificed some brain cells on mushrooms that might not be great for you, but always gets their name slightly wrong. very friendly and uncomfortably weird person
